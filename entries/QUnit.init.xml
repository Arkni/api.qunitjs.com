	<desc>Initialize the test runner.</desc>
	<longdesc>
		<p>If the runner has already run, calling <code>QUnit.init()</code> will re-initialize the runner, effectively resetting it. This method does not need to be called in the normal use of QUnit.</p>
		<p>This is useful for being able to use the test runner for multiple batches of dynamically-loaded tests (load a batch of tests, get the results, re-init, load a new batch, etc.).</p>
