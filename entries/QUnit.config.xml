    <option name="reorder" type="Boolean" default="true">
      <desc>
        By default, QUnit will run tests first that failed on a previous run. In a large testsuite, this can speed up testing a lot.
        <p>It can also lead to random erros, in case your testsuite has non-atomic tests, where the order is important. You should fix those issues, instead of disabling reordering!</p>
        </desc>
    </option>
    <option name="altertitle" type="Boolean" default="true">
      <desc>
        By default, QUnit updates document.title to add a checkmark or x-mark to indicate if a testsuite passed or failed. This makes it easy to see a suites result even without looking at a tab's content.
        <p>If you're dealing with code that tests <code>document.title</code> changes or have some other problem with this feature, set this option to false to disable it.</p>
      </desc>
    </option>
    <option name="requireExpects" type="Boolean" default="false">
      <desc>
        The <code>expect()</code> method is optional by default, though it can be useful to require each test to specify the number of expected assertions.
        <p>Enabling this option will cause tests to fail, if they don't call <code>expect()</code> at all.</p>

  <desc>Configuration for QUnit</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>QUnit has a bunch of internal configuration defaults, some of which are useful to override. Check the description for each option for details.</p>
